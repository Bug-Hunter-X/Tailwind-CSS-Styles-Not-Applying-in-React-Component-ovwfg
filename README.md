# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying in React Component

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles are not applied correctly in a React component. The `index.js` file contains a simple counter component that uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. However, the styles are not rendering as expected, resulting in a visually incorrect display.

The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the issue by ensuring that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and that class names are correctly applied.
